This tool was developed to help identify pages in a large dataset that may be
good candidates for Machine-Generated Austomatic Handwriting Processing tools.

Theoretically it could be used for other purposes like creating labeled images
for ML training, and/or identifying bounded boxes in images of interest for
varied DH projects.

For each image in the dataset, make notes and modifications to good candidates
and exclude blanks and/or poor candidates.

Once you are satisfied. export the csv results for processing in other tools.

See this project's readme for how-tos on acquiring data and customizing the
annotation tools.
