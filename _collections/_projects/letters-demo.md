This is a demo of this tool with a small collection of letters.
Consider the following use-cases.

You want:

1. To distinguish between handwritten and typed letters.
1. To exclude the verso of documents that are 'blank'
1. To identify 'difficult' to read text vs easily transcribed text.
1. To identify verso bleed-through, damage, etc.
1. To distinguish text that might exist in several columns, or orientations,
   and you want to crop, rotate, or distinguish those elements without having
   to use at tool like photoshop.
1. To label features of a document like a salutation, body, signature, markings,
   different written-hands, etc.
